# Student-Feedback-System
A college project based on web development
This site will allow students to check the marks of their class on a particular subject, see their regular and exam schedules, information regarding their faculty and submit a feedback form. The faculty members on the other hand can see the results of an individual student or check the results of the class on the whole, they can update the faculty list and the scoresheets and see the feedback for the faculty members.
